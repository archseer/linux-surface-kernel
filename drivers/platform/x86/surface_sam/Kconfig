    ---help---
      Drivers for the Surface/System Aggregator Module (SAM) of Microsoft
      Surface devices.

      SAM is an embedded controller that provides access to various
      functionalities on these devices, including battery status, keyboard
      events (on the Laptops) and many more.

      Say Y here if you have a Microsoft Surface device with a SAM device
      (i.e. 5th generation or later).

	---help---
	  Surface Serial Hub driver for 5th generation (or later) Microsoft
	  Surface devices.

	  This is the base driver for the embedded serial controller found on
	  5th generation (and later) Microsoft Surface devices (e.g. Book 2,
	  Laptop, Laptop 2, Pro 2017, Pro 6, ...). This driver itself only
	  provides access to the embedded controller (SAM) and subsequent
	  drivers are required for the respective functionalities.

	  If you have a 5th generation (or later) Microsoft Surface device, say
	  Y or M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SSH_DEBUG_DEVICE
	bool "Surface Serial Hub Debug Device"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	default n
	---help---
	  Debug device for direct communication with the embedded controller
	  found on 5th generation (and later) Microsoft Surface devices (e.g.
	  Book 2, Laptop, Laptop 2, Pro 2017, Pro 6, ...) via sysfs.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SAN
	tristate "Surface ACPI Notify Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	default m
	---help---
	  Surface ACPI Notify driver for 5th generation (or later) Microsoft
	  Surface devices.

	  This driver enables basic ACPI events and requests, such as battery
	  status requests/events, thermal events, lid status, and possibly more,
	  which would otherwise not work on these devices.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.

config SURFACE_SAM_VHF
	tristate "Surface Virtual HID Framework Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on HID
	default m
	---help---
	  Surface Virtual HID Framework driver for 5th generation (or later)
	  Microsoft Surface devices.

	  This driver provides support for the Microsoft Virtual HID framework,
	  which is required for the Surface Laptop (1 and newer) keyboard.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.

config SURFACE_SAM_DTX
	tristate "Surface Detachment System (DTX) Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on INPUT
	default m
	---help---
	  Surface Detachment System (DTX) driver for the Microsoft Surface Book
	  2. This driver provides support for proper detachment handling in
	  user-space, status-events relating to the base and support for
	  the safe-guard keeping the base attached when the discrete GPU
	  contained in it is running via the special /dev/surface-dtx device.

	  Also provides a standard input device to provide SW_TABLET_MODE events
	  upon device mode change.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SID
	tristate "Surface Platform Integration Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	default m
	---help---
	  Surface Platform Integration Driver for the Microsoft Surface Devices.
	  Currently only supports the Surface Book 2. This driver provides suport
	  for setting performance-modes via the perf_mode sysfs attribute.
	  Performance-modes directly influence the fan-profile of the device,
	  allowing to choose between higher performance or quieter operation.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.
